<li>We work with our clients to disciple stewards within their constituencies.</li>
<li>We teach our clients appropriate stewardship strategies and then help them implement those strategies.</li>
<li>We work as a team, both within the Timothy Group and between us and our client representatives. We use a multi-functional team of experts, led by a senior consultant, who bears responsibility for the successful outcome of our work. The composition of the team may change as the work progresses, but the senior consultant stays in charge, providing continuity.</li>
<li>As stewards of the resources God has entrusted to us, we provide high quality services at affordable prices.</li>
