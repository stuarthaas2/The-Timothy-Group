<p>The Timothy Group is rooted on the Scripture passage 1Timothy 6:17-19 which talks about stewardship in the Kingdom of God. From the beginning our emphasis has been on helping clients learn what is needed in financial development, just as Paul taught Timothy to teach the elders at Ephesus.
The Timothy Group brings a fresh perspective and sound biblical understanding, combined with years of stewardship and marketing experience to improve overall ministry effectiveness.</p>
